## About me

I'm mainly interested in open source software and work (mostly) only with it both at office and in personal life.

I like both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, so my interests are spanning a wide area; just to name the most important ones: operating systems internals, versioning, Python programming, software architecture.

I am currently working at [TRE srl](http://treuropa.com) in the field of satellite remote sensing, developing C and Python scientific applications for massive radar data processing.

## About this blog

This blog grows out of my desire to publish again a series of old articles on concurrent programming I wrote at the university to summarize some knowledge acquired during the operating systems class. The first articles you will find here, thus, are derived from that early work.

Here you will however find a large degree of topics, since many are my interests in the field of computer science (and elsewhere too, but you will not find them here). Cats are curious animals: so the title implies this is blog about curiosity in the digital world.

I strongly believe that learning is not a matter of procedures: that is just the surface of the real thing. {" Learning is understanding and understanding is asking why and how."} Thus on this blog I would like to avoid tutorials and howtos (if possible :-). I'd prefer to dive into topics, and the material you will find here is written directly by me, even if information comes obviously from the work of other people.

## About errors

Since english is not my mothertongue you will likely find horrible and disgraceful language errors.

Since computer science is my main occupation you will likely find every sort of absurdity.

Each error is a lesson... if someone corrects you. So please notify me any mistake or oversight.
