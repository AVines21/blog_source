Summary: An introduction to upcoming posts about Scala

A year has passed since I learned a new programming language.

I am a big fan of learning new things, and learning a new programming language is a big step. If a new programming language is developed, adopted by programmers and used in production by companies, that means that it solves some issues and provides good solutions to real problems. The other possibility is that it is artificially pushed by someone, but time usually filters such outliers.

A successful programming language is surrounded by a lot of libraries and frameworks, so learning it means walking into a new world. Not only new syntax, nomenclature and paradigms, but also new people, new "big names", new websites, new conventions and everything (good) the contemporary world may offer to the curious programmer.

Python is, by far, the language I use the most nowadays, followed by C. So one possibility for me was to dig into a new modern object-oriented language, such as Ruby. The other possibility was to change "side" and continue investigating functional languages. Erlang was a real surprise to me and I enjoyed learning it, even if I could not ultimately use it for my current job.

I decided to learn [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). I have never been attracted by Java, and never had the need to learn it, but I recognize that it is a very pervasive technology. A lot of things have been developed on the Java Virtual Machine so when I heard of Scala, a hybrid object-oriented/functional language that runs on the JVM I thought I found the good candidate for my new learning adventure.

When I learn something, however, I need real problems to solve with the new tools, so I looked for some good exercises for Scala programmers and found [S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). So I decided to solve them to learn Scala. And since writing my thoughts also helps me learn I'll publish some posts on the matter. I cannot forecast if I will have the time or the ability to solve all 99 problems, but hope that the result may be useful for other programmers approaching this interesting language.

The _Ninety-Nine Scala Problems_ site provides solutions for the problems, so my solutions will obviously be influenced by those, when not the same. After all I am a beginner so the given solution is what I consider the right one.

You will find the updated index of the solved problems [here](/blog/2015/04/02/99-scala-problems-index/).
